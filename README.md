# SR-CNN
Super resolution based on SRCNN using Keras (2.0)

Please refer to paper for more details on working https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00092v3.pdf
<br>
Two architectures are implemented. <br>1. Expanded Super Resolution CNN (ESRCNN) 
This gave pretty good results


<br>2. Denoiseing Super Resolution CNN (DSRCNN)<br>
This had better results than previous.

Both the model was trained on 2000 images for 500 epochs.<br>

Image dataset was downloaded from google images, refer to link
